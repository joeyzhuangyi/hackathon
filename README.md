Hoolie: Help each other out

'Hoolie' is a web/mobile application that provides an interface for an on-demand tutoring service. It is an app catered to students on campus who desire face to face help with University work. Upon use, students can select the course they need help with and the time they'd like to spend(ranging from 15 minutes to 1 hour). Hoolie then pairs the user with someone within a fixed radius who has completed the course, and is able to assist them. The distance from the user and time spent helping them are factored in to calculate a virtual cost of 'HooCoins' which are spent to request help, and received upon helping another student.
